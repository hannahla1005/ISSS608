In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\nWe can adjust the position of adhere small chart.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.015, \n                   bottom = 0.65, \n                   right = 0.45, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

    "text": "9.4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nA Raincloud Plot is a data visualization technique that adds a half-density plot to a distribution plot. It gets its name because the density plot resembles a “raincloud.” This type of plot improves upon the traditional boxplot by highlighting multiple modes, which can indicate the presence of different groups. While a boxplot does not show where data points are concentrated, a raincloud plot does.\nWe will use functions from the ggdist and ggplot2 packages to generate the plot.\n\n9.4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, the second geometric layer is added using geom_boxplot() from ggplot2, creating a narrow boxplot. The width is reduced, and the opacity is adjusted for better visibility.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, the third geometric layer is added using stat_dots() from the ggdist package. This creates a half-dot plot, similar to a histogram, where the number of dots represents the sample count in each bin. Setting side = “left” places the dots on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() from the ggplot2 package flips the raincloud chart horizontally, giving it the characteristic raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() from the ggthemes package is applied to achieve a professional, publication-quality look.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n3.7.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot using plot_ly\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot using ggplotly\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk"

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!."

    "text": "6.7 Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package\n\n6.7.1 Getting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn the corrplot package, there are seven visualization methods (defined by the method parameter) to represent correlation values: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color, and pie. By default, circle is used. As shown earlier, the standard visualization in a corrplot matrix is the circle method.\ndefault setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n&lt;1. Change Visualization Method&gt; and &lt;2. Change Color Scheme&gt;\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\",\n         col = colorRampPalette(c(\"purple\", \"white\", \"#00A600\"))(200)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3 Working with layout\n&lt;3.Change the Layout&gt;\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\",\n         col = colorRampPalette(c(\"purple\", \"white\", \"#00A600\"))(200),\n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;4. Add or Remove Labels&gt;\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\",\n         col = colorRampPalette(c(\"purple\", \"white\", \"#00A600\"))(200),\n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.4 Working with mixed layout\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor,\n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\",\n               )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince corrplot.mixed() doesn’t accept col, the default blue-red color gradient used for ellipse.\n\n\n6.7.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\n&lt;5. Adjust Significance Level&gt;\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         \n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.6 Reorder a corrgram\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details. 角度特徵向量排序\n“FPC” for the first principal component order. 第一主成分排序\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used. 階層式聚類排序\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order. 按字母順序排列\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n        col = colorRampPalette(c(\"purple\", \"white\", \"#00A600\"))(200),\n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "15.4 Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nLet’s learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package.\n\n15.4.1 Plotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used.\nData argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n15.4.2 Plotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. Let’s learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Parallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.4 Rotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Adjusting the rotated x-axis text label\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"
